# MathJax basic tutorial and quick reference

1. To see how any formula was written in any question or answer, including this one, right-click on the expression it and choose "Show Math As > TeX Commands". (When you do this, the '$' will not display. Make sure you add these. See the next point.)
2. *For inline formulas, enclose the formula in ```$...$```. For displayed formulas, use ```$$...$$```.*
3. These render differently. For example, type ``` $\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$  ``` to show
$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$
(which is inline mode) or type
``` $$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$ ```
to show
$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
